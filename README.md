# advertisement_recommendation

## Introduction
This repository results from my Udacity Nanodegree. The goal is to analyse the datasets in 
the example_data folder and recommend customers offers that are profitable for the business. 

## Data Acquisition
Exemplary data is provided in the example_data folder. The data can be extended and/or changed as desired.

## Files
The main file in this project is the recommender.py file. Here, the algorithms for the recommendation engine are implemented.

## Results
The key findings are, that most of the promotions don't cause profit.
